- **Verification Details:** What specific information and documentation will be required to verify a scout? (e.g., club/organization email, ID verification, letter from the organization?)
- **AI Rating System:** What are the specific metrics for the AI rating system for each sport? This will require domain experts. For example, what defines a "good" soccer dribble vs. a "good" basketball jump shot?
- **Data Privacy:** How will athlete data be handled, especially for minors? What are the specific privacy controls for athletes?
- **Launch Strategy:** Which sport(s) will the platform launch with initially to prove the concept before expanding?
